Collection of utilities to bootstrap a small raiden network.
-------

# About the environment

The environment uses [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage the python
virtual environments and most of the scripts and utilities are configured around that fact.


# Setting up the environment

For the virtual environment you have to run:

```bash
mkvirtualenv test-scripts
```

Activating the environment can be done by

```bash
workon test-scripts
```

Then as soon as you are in the virtual environment you can use `pip` to install the dependencies
for the scripts:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

For the private chain setup to work you need to have parity installed since the setup uses a [Parity Dev Chain](https://wiki.parity.io/Private-development-chain)

You can start by copying the example setup and getting your setup ready.

```bash
cp setup-environment.example.sh setup-environment.sh
```

Then source the `setup-environment.sh` to load the environment.

```bash
source setup-environment.sh
```

This provides an alias `raiden-up` that can be used to easily start raiden nodes.
This also provides the `dev-chain-reset` alias that is used to reset the development chain.

In the `setup-environment.sh` script the accounts should be `:` separated

```bash
export RT_ENV__TESTING_ACCOUNTS='account1:account2:account3'
```

The passphrases should be stored in individual text files with filenames 'account1', 'account2' etc with the passphrase inside.
The account name should be prefixed with `0x` and the account should be in checksum format.


# Using the script

Then you can call the script 
```bash
âžœ raiden-up -n rinkeby -a 0 -e production -l y
```

# Available flags

The following flags are available for the script.

* -n: network (can be 'rinkeby', 'ropsten' or 'kovan')
* -a: account (the index of the account in `RT_ENV__TESTING_ACCOUNTS` 0 is the first account)
* -e: environment (production/development)
* -l: local transport **y** (if the option is specified the *transport01.raiden.network* is used instead)
* -b: path to the binary. (If not specified it will used raiden from the virtual enviroment else it will use the specified binary)
* -p: private chain setup. (This will pass information to raiden to work with the private chain) *You might need to change the addresses dependending on the deployment on the parity dev chain)


# Starting a the private chain

This is a small utility that starts a parity dev chain with RPC enabled.
It also funds the accounts that are in the `RT_ENV__TESTING_ACCOUNTS` environment variable and then
sends a single transfer from the default account to the first account every `--block-time` seconds
to simulate a stable block time.


```bash
./start_private_chain.py --block-time=1   
```

# Deploying the raiden smart contracts

## Before installing

You can run the `solidity.sh` script to install the proper version of `solc` in your virtual environment to be able to 
compile the `raiden-contracts`. Currently the compilation process fails with solidity `0.5.0`.

# Installation
 
In order for the private raiden network to work you need to deploy the smart contracts on your private chain.

```bash
python -m raiden_contracts.deploy raiden --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key /home/kelsos/.ethereum/testnet/keystore/0x82641569b2062B545431cF6D7F0A418582865ba7 --gas-price 10 --gas-limit 6000000   
```

## Deploying the test contract

```bash
python -m raiden_contracts.deploy token --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key /home/kelsos/.ethereum/testnet/keystore/0x82641569b2062B545431cF6D7F0A418582865ba7 --gas-price 10 --token-supply 10000000 --token-name TestToken --token-decimals 18 --token-symbol TTT
```

## Registering the test token

```bash 
python -m raiden_contracts.deploy register --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key /home/kelsos/.ethereum/testnet/keystore/0x82641569b2062B545431cF6D7F0A418582865ba7 --gas-price 10 --token-address 0x28104EE15e1c70c421150865C3fb731c426929E6 --registry-address 0xA4e13D328308194c0AB4E10bB1f2B2e8d624d240

```

Currently `raiden-contracts` doesn't support a single command deployment of all the contracts (raiden, token) along 
with the registration. For this reason `scripts/deploy_testnet.py` is a script that is patched together from the 
[deploy script](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/master/raiden_contracts/deploy/__main__.py)
that helps you deploy everything in a single command.

# Funding the accounts

The send tokens script is responsible for funding all the accounts with tokens.

> Please make sure to use the same keystore that you used to deploy the smart contracts.
> This account should contain some tokens.

The script will pick up the accounts on the `RT_ENV__TESTING_ACCOUNTS` environment variable and 
send tokens for testing to all of them.

```bash
./send_tokens.py --keystore-file ~/.ethereum/testnet/keystore/0x82641569b2062B545431cF6D7F0A418582865ba7 --password 123 --token 0x28104EE15e1c70c421150865C3fb731c426929E6
```

# Using raiden-up to start a local node

This will start a raiden node that uses the private dev chain. The production environment will 
be the same one with the `Red Eyes` contract version.

```bash
raiden-up -n local -a 3 -e production -p true
```

# Opening channels

While you can always use the REST API or the WebUI for opening channels, there is also the `scripts/open_channels.py`.
The script will take a `yml` configuration and will open channels to other nodes.

Please make sure to include even nodes that will not open any channels, since the script automatically funds 
all the open channels to all directions.

```bash
./scripts/open_channels.py --token 0x28104EE15e1c70c421150865C3fb731c426929E6 --config config/channels.yml
```

# Running the transfers

The script for running transfers will take `yml` configuration specifying the targets of the transfers
and the the total amount to be transferred.

```bash
./scripts/transfers.py --token 0x28104EE15e1c70c421150865C3fb731c426929E6 --config config/transfers.yml
```


# Running a local synapse (matrix server) 

> Currently using a local synapse version is not working due to a crash on raiden client.

Run `tools\install_synapse.sh` from the [raiden repo](https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/blob/master/tools/install_synapse.sh)

After synapse is installed then you can go to run synapse by executing `run_synapse.sh` from the directory where synapse was installed in the previous script.

Add the url of the local matrix server to your hosts file:
```bash
# Static table lookup for hostnames.
# See hosts(5) for details.
127.0.0.1 matrix.local.raiden

```
